      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

<div style="text-align: justify">
I’m a Food Scientist and currently a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Anderson Lab at The Pennsylvania State University, where I work on the “Food Resilience” project. My research focuses on converting inedible plant biomass into edible, nutrient-rich food ingredients—particularly single-cell foods high in protein and fat. I’m passionate about sustainable food systems, novel food development, and nutrient optimization through innovative processing technologies.
I’m also a husband, father, brother, and son—with a camera in one hand and a song often in my head. Science is my work, but curiosity is my way of life.
