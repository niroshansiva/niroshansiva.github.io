    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Food Scientist, currenlty a postdoctoral scholar in Anderson Lab, The Pennsylvania State University, working of the "Food Resilience" project. My research interests include converting inedible plant biomass to edible foods, novel food development to provide balance nutrients, and food processing. Currnelty, I am devloping single-cell foods rich in protien and fat from inedible plant biomass.
