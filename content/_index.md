      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: 'The path to resilient food systems begins by transforming what we overlook today into the nourishment we rely on tomorrow'
      text: |-
        The global food system is under growing pressure to ensure equitable access to safe, nutritious, and affordable food, as climate change, land degradation, and population growth strain traditional agriculture. Innovative, resource-efficient solutions are urgently needed. My research integrates food chemistry with sustainable processing technologies and value-added product development to address these challenges. By transforming underutilized agricultural biomass and food waste into affordable, nutrient-rich, and culturally relevant ingredients, my work supports both global food resilience and local food systems. Through a science-driven, community-engaged approach, I aim to enhance food security and promote healthier, more sustainable diets.
